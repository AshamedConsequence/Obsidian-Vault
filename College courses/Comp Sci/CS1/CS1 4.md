There are different autonomy levels for cars, ranging from 0 to 5.

Most industries are trying to aim for level 4 cars. 

We call the self driving car "ego"

But how do you do it?

* mapping, we use semantic maps, which are much more detailed maps with centimeter level resolution specifically made for autonomous vehicles. They have exact details on each intersection of crosswalks, traffic lights, stop signs, parking locations, etc. 
	* This means that autonomous vehicles are geofenced, they only work where semantic maps exist. 
	* They use lidar to map the area a car can drive. Similar to echolocation

* Route planning, an off vehicle system computes an optimal route for ego. Very similar to google maps. Look up A* algorithm and openstreetmap.
* perception
	* There are three modalities we use:
		* Lidar
		* Camera
		* Radar
	* We feed this info into convolutional neural networks to get recognition. Kalman filters used to give IDs to objects, which allows us to compute their velocity. 
* Localization, 
	* We can't use GPS, since it has 5m of location accuracy, which means we need to use other systems like IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units). It uses this in combination with lidar to get cm level accuracy.
* Prediction
	* A prediction system predicts other vehicles' future behaviors based on recent history.
	* It can use other info such as traffic lights, other agents, etc, to predict future movement. There is multi modal prediction, meaning it predicts many different future outcomes. 
	* Neural networks used for this prediction. 
 * Behavior planning
	 * This means creating a high level maneuver for these self driving cars. The behavior planner basically just gives high level suggestions for the car.
	 * Use traffic elements, and static models, to impact behavior planner.
* Trajectory generation
	* Trajectory generation make a kinematically feasible trajectory for ego. 
	* Most trajectories are randomly generated, and then evaluated.

* Control system tranforms trajectory into actual movement

We also need to do simulations, metrics, cyber security, validation, and machine learning infrastructure.
