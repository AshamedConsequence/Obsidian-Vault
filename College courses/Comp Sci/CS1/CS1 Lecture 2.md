Programming Languages
Past, Present, and Future. 

Computer code is running the world, every aspect of our life.

Hardware only understands very simple language called machine code.
We abstracted this to assembly language. 

Programming languages begin to exist to make it much easier for human beings to understand.

But the computer doesn't understand python, we use an interpreter for it to run, or a compiler in the case of C.

This is great butâ€¦ These compilers and interpreters are programs too.

:scream:

It seems like an infinite regress, but they had to write the first compiler in machine code.

The two reasons why computers are powerful in our world is because they can communicate with other computers, and that computers can talk about all different types of data. Even though the computer can only understand numbers, numbers can represent everything. 

**ALL DATA CAN BE ENCODED AS NUMBERS**
**The computer can also hook up to other devices**

There are many different languages, but mainly 3 common programming metaphors.
* Imperative programming
* Functional Programming
* Object Oriented Programming

English as a programming language is a pipe dream. GPT 3.5 can automate small tasks, but still needs human judgement.

Uncertainty is everywhere. 

Like how a doctor isn't sure about what disease a person has, some programs are running on uncertainty as well.

There are also probabilistic programming language.

Software is eating the world. As software becomes much more widespread, software errors are as well.

We are going into provable software guarantees, with things such as computer networks, and mathematical proofs.

Summary:

all that computers do is execute programs

Programming languages make computers smarts
* significantly raise the level of discourse in talking to computers
* compilers and interpreters bridge the gap.

Each language provides its own unique way of thinking about computation

There is lots more to be done.
