Cross-cultural/intellectual pollination in Google's X, the moonshot factory

X is a sister company with google, part of the alphabet family.

They try to solve one of a kind solution to problems and try to make it reproducible for all different types of problems.

They look for huge problems, try to use radical solutions to solve it and use breakthrough technology. 

# Principles at X, the Google One
- They aim for 10X solutions not 10%, to challenge assumptions on how things are today.
- Work on the hardest thing first, we want to quickly learn if there is a path forward to this solution
- Make contact with the real world. They encourage fast testing in order to see if it is feasible to do this solution. Don't be afraid to build the v0.crap
- Fall in love with the problem. The worst thing to have is cool tech that no one wants to use. 
- Build in diverse perspectives. 
- Embrace ~failure~ learning

# Tips
- Ask that dumb question. It's always important to revisit these questions as we go across the journey.
- Don't be afraid of failure
- Don't be afraid of hearing "No." Rejection allows for better discussions and questions.
- Find a mentor **and** a sponsor in your life. In a world where leadership doesn't look like you, its important to get a sponsor. Decision makers of the opportunities already know who they want to promote, it isn't a meritocracy. Sponsor is someone who knows my worth and potential.
- Diversity and inclusion are good for business.
	- Google glass had a diversity issue.
	- Google product launching in thailand, which needed user ID validation, using credit card information, but thai's don't use credit cards. They didn't realize this in the beginning. So they ended up partnering with large bank.

# Questions:
- What would you say to a queer engineer in terms of getting into the industry?
	- Don't give up, your unique experiences and the problems you faced and the way technology could help solve those problems are important. You see stuff other people don't see. 
- As AI is rapidly advancing, are we seeing the same advancement in hardware?
	- This concept of Moore's law, machine learning data, there isn't enough being generated for training.
