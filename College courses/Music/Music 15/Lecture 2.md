try to focus on just base line in music. 

Music emerges from a physical phenomenon.

How do we hear?

We need a medium to carry vibrations from the sonic information. 

Frequency represents pitch
Amplitude represents the volume of the sound
Duration is the length of time the sound goes on for
Timbre is what makes a sound unique, its how many simultaneous frequencies being listened to at the same time and the amplitude of each frequency.

Pitch is logarithmic, doubling the frequency makes it sound similar to the base frequency 

loud things move a lot of air, and soft things move less air.

Our brain makes sense of these sounds based on the culture we have assimilated, which dictates how we physically hear something and how we mentally and emotionally respond to it. 

Hearing is physical, listening takes into account who+where you were+are.

dynamics and timbre are eurocentric terms.

Music takes meaning from its environment with its physical location and its abstract location.
