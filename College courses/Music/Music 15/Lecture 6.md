Rhythm:
Consider how rhythm works in contemporary music is caused by the african diaspora.

5 principles of african diasporic music:
1) Bodily motion
	- It' s an integral part of the music making process.
	- Music is not a separate thing from dance in african music.
2) High density of musical events.
3) Call-and-response. 
	* It involves the audience
4) Singing or playing any instrument in a percussive manner.
	* Almost every instrument is a kind of drum in african music.
5) Rhythmic contrast organizes the music. 
	* WE could feel this by playing beats on 4's or 2's and contrasting it with beats on 3's.
	* We abstract the idea of a repeating rhythm using a matrix. It loops.
	* The patterns of notes have different lengths.
	* Polyrhythms are a form of rhythmic contrast.
