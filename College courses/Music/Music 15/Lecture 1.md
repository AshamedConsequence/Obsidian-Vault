Perceptions and definitions of music:

How do we define music?

The google definition is "vocal or instrumental sounds combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion", but this is a cop out.

It's all subjective.

Lots of music was made for religious purposes. 

Webster also defines music as "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity," meaning basically that music has intention behind the sounds being made.

Charlie Parker says "music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art." He doesn't want other people to define his music.

Luciano Berio: "Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music."

Reactions:
The balinese stuff seemed to be off tempo in the beginning. 

It's hard to notice the cymbals in the back of charlie parker's track. It get's over powered by all the other instruments. 

Sinfonia sounds a bit chaotic for classical music. TF why is there people just speaking actual words in english?

Soundwalk is just beach noises, with narration.

I felt that the video wasn't that important.
