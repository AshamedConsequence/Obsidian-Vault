Tangent creation

If you have two different points $(x_{1}, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope of the line which passes through these points is: $$\frac{(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)}$$

The slope of the tangent line is **close** to the difference of y divided by the difference of x.

We could choose any arbitrary point to find the slope at a certain point. For example, we could use 3.1 and 3 instead of 4 and 3:

$$ Slope \approx\frac{3.1^2-9}{3.1-3}=\frac{0.61}{0.1}=6.1$$

Or even 3.000001 and 3:

$$ Slope \approx\frac{3.00001^2-9}{3.00001-3}=\frac{0.000061}{0.00001}=6.0001$$

We close in on our intuition that the slope should be 6.
