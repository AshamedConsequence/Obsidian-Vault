Vectors:

A vector $\vec{PQ}$ is a directed line segment connecting points P and Q $\in \mathbb{R}$ 

Algebraically, we think of points as vectors emanating from the origin.

The "length" of a vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by the square root of the sum of its coordinates. It's defined like this because of the pythagorean theorem repeated ad infinitum.   

Unlike with real numbers, there is not a natural way to multiply vectors together.

$||\vec{v}+\vec{w}|| \leq ||\vec{v}|| + ||\vec{w}||$

Every vector can be represented as the sum of the basis vectors. 

The parametric equation of the line L passing throw $v_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ in the direction of $\vec{v}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is: $$\vec{v_0} + t\vec{v}$$

 for $t \in \mathbb{R}$
