What are we working on today:
Quadric surfaces (imagine haveing the standard form for surfaces as discussed previously, but the x, y, and z terms are squared).


Example:
$ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dxy + exz + fyz + gx+hy+iz+j = 0$ but imagine only combinations of x,y,and z is = 0 for today.


We can define a sphere of radius r as a quadric surface of the form $x^2+y^2 + z^2  = r^2$ 

Recall:
Conic sections are curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$, such as parabolas, hyperbolas, circles, ellipses, and degenerate conics, such as conics defined by $x^2 = a$, a point, crossing lines, regular lines, etc. 

Definition:
A trace of a surface $S$ is the curve of intersection of $S$ with a plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes. 

Example:

$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2+(z/c)^2 =1$$
The quadric surface described by the equation above is an ellipsoid, basically an ellipse in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
We can visualize the entirety of a quadric surface using the traces along each of the coordinate axis. 
$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z/c)^2-1$$
This is a hyperbeloid of two sheets. 

(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z/c)^2-1$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z/c)^2-1$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z/c)^2-1$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z/c)^2-1$$
For z=$z_0$ traces,  $$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=(z_0/c)^2-1$$
basically, when |z_0| >= c, this equation describes an elippse. We can take the vertical traces created by plugging random numbers into z_0 to get an idea of the surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

$$
(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2 = (z/c)^2 +1
$$
The equation above is for a hyperboloid of one sheet, basically a horizontal hyperbola where when you cut a vertical trace, they are hyperbolas, and at certian points, they are traces.

___
Elliptic cone:
$$ (x/a)^2+(y/b)^2 = (z/c)^2$$
z traces:
* ellipses at any point not z_0  = 0
* Point at z_0 = 0

x & y traces:
* Pairs of crossed lines or hyperbolas.


___
Paraboloids:
We have two types of paraboloids:
Elleptic:
$$ z = (x/a)^2+(y/b)^2$$
The z traces are ellipses and vertical traces are parabolas

Hyperbolic:

$$ z = (x/a)^2 - (y/b)^2$$
The z traces are either crossing lines or hyperbolas and vertical traces are parabolas.
