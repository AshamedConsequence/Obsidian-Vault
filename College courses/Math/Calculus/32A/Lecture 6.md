Last time:

We got deep into 13.5.

A plane is defined by a normal vector and a point.

I'ts the set of points Q such that $\vec{PQ}\cdot \vec{n} = 0$ 

3 non colinear points can define a plane. 

To prove that they aren't colinear, we just create two vectors using one of these points as the "anchor/tail" and then checking if these vectors are parallel. If they aren't then these points define a plane based on the tail and the cross product of the vectors. 

PQ = <-2, 1,0> PR = <-2,0,1>

PQ x PR = 1 i + 2j + 2k

We can also determine a plane based on a line in the plane and a point that is not on the line, which belongs to the plane, duh, since you can take like 2 points on the line to the same thing as above. 

same thing with 2 parallel lines. same thing with 2 non parallel lines who intersect. 

Definition:

Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. 
If two plane intersect,, meaning they aren't parallel, they intersect on a line.
If two planes intersect, and each plane respectively has a parallel line d and d', the line of intersection of these two planes will be parallel to those lines.

Definition:

A trace of a plane $\mathbb{P}$ is the intersection of the plane with a plane that is parallel to one of the coordinate planes. 

Example:
Find the trace of 2x+y+z = 3 when x=0.

Answer: Find the line defined by y + z = 3.
