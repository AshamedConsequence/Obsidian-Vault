We saw that any continuous function $f$ defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ always has a max and min and it always occurs at critical points, meaning x values where the derivative of $f$ is 0 or $f'(x)$ doesn't exist, or endpoints (i.e. x=a or x=b) 

Question: 
Sketch a graph o the function f(x) = $2x^3-15x^2+24x+7$ on $[0,6]$

Important first step, find the critical points.

Let's figure out where the critical points are. 

First we calculate the derivative

$$f'(x) = 6x^2-30x+24$$

By doing some factorizing we find that the critical points are 1 and 4.

Let's now sketch the derivative:

Currently all we know so far is that the derivative of f is 0 when you plug in 1 and 0 when you plug in 4 and that these are the only inputs that make the derivative 0. 

We also know that $f'(0) = 24$

# IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS POINT FULLY, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE REST.

Can f'(1/2) be negative? Answer: NO. 
This is improtant for reason that I will explain wmen I rewrite my notes 

We know that f'(x) > 0 if x is between 0 and 1, and f'(x) < 0 if x is between 1 and 4. Deos the graph of f(x) have a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither at the x-value 1.

We can see that on the left hand side of x=1, the function is going up, and on the right its going down, which means that it must be a local max.

We can see that on the left hand side of x=4, the function is going down, and on the right its going up, which means that it must be a local min.

There are two ways to see if a critical point is a local max/min/neither.

We can do either sign analysis, or we can do the second derivative test.

___
Second derivative test:

If a function f has a critical point at the x-value c, then:
* if $f''(c) > 0$ then f has a local min at c, because the function will concave down like a frown
* if $f''(c) < 0$ then f has a local max at c, because the function will be concave up like a cup
* if $f''(c) = 0$ then no information can be derived.
