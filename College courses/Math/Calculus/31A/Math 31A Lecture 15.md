What we did last week:

We sketched the graph where the critical points of a function $f$ 

We determined whether critical points of a function f were a local max, local min, or neither by doing a **sign analysis** on the derivative

Look at [[Drawing 2023-11-08 17.04.14.excalidraw]]

When we look at the critical point 1, we see that the tangent line goes from increasing to decreasing, meaning it's a local max

When we look a the critical point 4, we see that the tangent line goes from decreasing to increasing, meaning it's a local min.

We can also use the second derivative to find the local min/max, but it's not guaranteed to work.

If c is a critical point then:
* $f''(c) > 0$ => The function is concave up like a cup => The function has a local min at c
* $f''(c) < 0$ => The function is concave down like a frown => The function has a local max at c
* $f''(c) = 0$ => There is no new information yielded from doing this test

$f$ is concave up <==> $f'$ is increasing <==> $f''$ is positive
$f$ is concave down <==> $f'$ is down <==> $f''$ is negative

12x-30 = 0 <==> x=5/2

$[-\infty,5/2)$ is concave down

$(5/2,6]$ is concave up
