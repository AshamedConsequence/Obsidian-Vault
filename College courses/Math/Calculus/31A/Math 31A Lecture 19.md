Today we are computing the area under the curve:

Question:
Given a function f(x), what is the area between the function and the x-axis.

Idea: We can approximate this area by two rectangles:\

The approximation we have is: 8 + 32
Using more rectangles, we find that the area is approximating:
1+4+9+16= 30

The more rectangles we use, the better the approximation will be.

We call what we did a right Riemann sum since the height of the rectangle is determined by its right side.

But we can also do a left Riemann sum too.

To express Reimann sums with sigma notation,

$$\frac{\text{length of intervalu}}{\text{\# rectangles}}$$

When doing limits, sigma notation become integrals.
