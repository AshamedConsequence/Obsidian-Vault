Chain rule allows us to calculate things that are related to each other. 

# RELATED RATES

A spherical balloon has a radius $r$ which is increasing at a constant rate of $3 cm/sec$. At what rate is the volume V of the balloon at the moment when the radius is 10 cm.

V = $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$

To solve this, we can take this equation and take the derivative on both sides with respect to time. 

$$\frac{dV}{dt}= 4*\pi r^2*\frac{dr}{dt}$$

At the moment when r = 10cm: $$\frac{dV}{dt} = 4*\pi*(10cm)^2*3\frac{cm}{sec} = 1200\pi\frac{cm^3}{sec}$$

How to solve related rates problems: Step 1: don't panic.
Question:
A hot air balloon is rising straight up from a level field and is tracked by a range-finder 150 meters away from the lift-off point. At the moment when the rangefinder's angle of elevation is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, the angle of elevation is increasing at a rate of 0.14 radians per minute. How fast is the balloon rising at that moment?
