What we learned last time:

Integration and sums have similar properties (e.g. distributive property or commutativity of addition)

Fundamental theomerem of calculus:

If f(x) is any continuous function and F(x) is any function with F'(x) = f(x) then 

$$
\int^b_af(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

A function F(x) where F'(x) = f(x) is called the anti-derivative of f(x).

The indefinite integral of f(x), written:

$$
\int f(x)dx
$$

means all function which have derivative f(x)

Theorem:

If f(x) is a function where F'(x) = f(x) then any function with derivative f(x) is equal to F(x) + c for a constant c.

$$
	\int x^ndx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}
$$

We call this the inverse power rule.
