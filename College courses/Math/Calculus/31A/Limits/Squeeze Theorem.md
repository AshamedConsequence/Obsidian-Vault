Some limits can be evaluated using the Squeeze Theorem.

We can use the squeeze theorem when we have two function that we know are below and above the function whose limits, and whose limits converge to a point. 

Example:
If $\theta$ is in the set $(\frac{-\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4})$ and $\theta\neq0$, then $\cos(\theta) \leq \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} \leq 1$

As $\theta$ approaches 0, $\cos\theta$ and 1 approach one, meaning that $\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}$ approaches 1 as well.
