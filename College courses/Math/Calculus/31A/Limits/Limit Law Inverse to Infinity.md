$$\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{1}{x^p} = 0$$

for all x and all p.

## BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR $x\to -\infty$

$$\lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^p} = 0$$

Is mostly true if p is part of the real numbers. To be more specific, there are certain number is the real numbers which give complex limits, which are not covered in this class.
