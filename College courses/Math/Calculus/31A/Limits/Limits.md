We say that $$\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L$$

 if $$\lim_{x\to c^{+}} f(x) = L$$

 and 

$$\lim_{x\to c^{-}} f(x) = L$$

If either of those don't exist or they aren't the same then: 

$$\lim_{x\to c^{+}} f(x) \text{ does not exist} $$

(There is a difference on whether the limit is undefined or does not exist, but it does not matter)

Limits are subject to [[Limit Laws]] that we can use to evaluate them much more easily.

Using limits, we can show that functions are [[Continuity|continuous]]

When evaluating limits, we might stumble upon an [[Indeterminate forms|indeterminate form]], which means we need to do more function manipulation in order to compute the value of the limit.

There is a special type of limit called [[derivation|the derivative]] that we will use often.
