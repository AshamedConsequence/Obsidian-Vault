How to maximize/minimize functions

Example:
A piece of wire of length 16m is bent into the shape of a rectangle. What are the lengths of the sides which make the area of the rectangle maximal?

L * (8-L) = A = 8L -$L^2$  

16 = 2\*L + 2\*h

8-L = h

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = -2L+8$$

One way to see w = 4 gives the **global** max is to use you physical intuition to find endpoints i in this case, w varies from 0 to 8. its like
