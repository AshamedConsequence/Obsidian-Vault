Last time we talked about

If f'(a) exists for some domain value a, the for x-values near a, the graph of f and the graph of the tangent line look basically the same. 

In particular:

$$
f'(a) > 0 \text{ means that f is increasing at a} 
$$

$$
f'(a) < 0 \text{ means that f is decreasing at a} 
$$

6x^2-30x+24

30 +- sqrt(900-4\*6\*24)/12

Note: At the x-value where x is smallest, $f'(x) = 0$

Theorem:
if $f$ is a continuous function defined on a closed interval [a,b] ,then f always has a (global) max and a (global) min.

If one of the prerequisites aren't true, there is no guarantee that this will hold up.

These (global) max/mins always occur at:
* x-values with f'(x) = 0 or undefined (called critical points) or 
* At the end points, i.e. the x-value a or the x-value b.

Definition: For a function f, we say a local max/min occurs at an x value a and is $f(a)$ if $f(a)$ is the largest/smallest value of $f(x)$ for x near a.
