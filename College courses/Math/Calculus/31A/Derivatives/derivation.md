A derivative is defined as:

$$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx}$$

(all those notations are equivalent)

Derivation is a special type of [[Limits|limit]] which we can use to find the instantaneous rate of change of a function.

In other words it means that when we calculate the derivative of a [[function]], we are making a new function that plots how fast the original function changes over time. 

We can evaluate derivatives much faster using [[Derivative rules|derivation rules]], similar to how [[Limit Laws|limit laws]] help in evaluating limits.

We can check if a function is [[Differentiability|differentiable]], in order to see if the derivative exists at that point.

We can also use derivatives on things that are not functions, using [[Implicit Derivation]]. 

We are also not limited to just taking one derivative. This process can be repeated basically forever. But most of the time, we will limit ourselves to taking the [[second derivative]]
