If $a$ is a positive number, $$\frac{d}{dx} a^x = a^x*\ln{a}$$

following the logic:

$$\frac{d}{dx}a^x = \frac{d}{dx} (e^{\ln{a}*x}) = e^{\ln{a}*x}*\frac{d}{dx} (\ln{a}*x) = a^x *\ln{a}$$

Basically we are writing a in a very clever way in order to use [[euler's number]] which has specific properties which make taking the derivative much easier.
