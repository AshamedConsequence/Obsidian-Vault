We see on this function that at the point -4, if we were to pour water on the graph, it would go down like a frown (Concave down) and if we were to do the same thing at the point 3, it would hold water and keep it up like a cup (concave up).

# NOTATION TIME ðŸ¥³

This is about the second derivative

$$f'(x) \text{ is the first derivative}
$$

$$f''(x) \text{ is the second derivative}$$
