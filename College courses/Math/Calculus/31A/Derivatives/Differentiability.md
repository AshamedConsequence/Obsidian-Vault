Differentiability: A function f is differentiable at some domain value a if 

$$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$

exists.

If a function is differentiable, that implies that it is [[Continuity|continuous]] at that point. However, the inverse is not true, meaning that if a function is continuous at a point, that does not mean it is differentiable.

Example:
$|x|$ is continuous at 0, but is not differentiable at that point.
