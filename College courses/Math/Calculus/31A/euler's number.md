There is a number called e (Euler's number):

$$e\approx 2.718281828459045â€¦$$

You can make an exponential function out of this e^x and this function has the property that $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)=e^x$

Example:

Compute $\frac{d}{dx}7^x = \frac{d}{dx} (e^{\ln{7}*x}) = e^{\ln{7}*x}*\frac{d}{dx} (\ln{7}*x) = 7^x *\ln{7}$
