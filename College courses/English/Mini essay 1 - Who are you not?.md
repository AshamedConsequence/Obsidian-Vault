It's hard enough to describe myself using characteristics I possess, with each word used during this self reflection being an integral part of my character. It's even harder to do so using the absence of characteristics. Doesn't mean I won't try though. 
I've never enjoyed _school-writing_ because it always felt as though I wasn't writing what I wanted to say, but rather writing for the grade, to please a teacher, to just pass the class.

There are two "nots" that I'd use to describe me. The "nots" that I never want to be, and the "nots" that I want to change.

I'm not a master of one trade. Even though I'm here in college to specialize in one major, I still have this urge to explore, to see all that there is to see, do all there is to do. It's been that way since childhood for me. The hundreds of "dreams" I had growing up, ranging from chef, economist, and even professional fighter, each making me more curious about the world around me and all there is to learn. And even though I won't be able to accomplish them all, I'm still proud of all the skills and abilities that these dreams and obsessions taught me, and will continue to learn all I can. 

I'm not a dry, dull, stem major. I appreciate the arts and the humanities. Even if I'm not the most talented in these subjects, I still try to have fun, 

I'm not someone who does things right the first time around: from taking shortcuts, cutting corners, and even procrastinating. I couldn't tell you why I started doing this. All I know is I want to stop. I should've changed myself in the past, where it would be easier to kick these nasty habits, but now is also a good time.
